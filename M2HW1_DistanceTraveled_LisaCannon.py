# Calculating the distance traveled by a car.
speed = '70'
distanceAfter6 = 70 * 6
distanceAfter10 = 70 * 10
distanceAfter15 = 70 * 15

# Distance after 6 hours at 70mph.
print("The distance traveled after 6 hours at 70 mph is", distanceAfter6)


# Distance after 10 hours at 70mph.
print("The distance traveled after 10 hours at 70 mph is", distanceAfter10)

# Distance after 15 hours at 70mph.
print("The distance traveled after 15 hours at 70 mph is", distanceAfter15)


# I do not feel that I met the objective of this assignment.
# I would think that I should be calculating a formula such as 'distanceAfter6 = speed * 6',
# but when I do that I get six 70's in a row. EPIC FAIL!
